## Transformation macros

MERLIN provides a number of macros to use for transformations. If you don't know what bullet transformations are, you should check out [this page](#s=modding/transforms).

### How it works
MERLIN defines a whole bunch of inline functions for every transformation to make them easier to use. There also exist globaldefs for transformation type IDs, but they are meant for internal use and may be changed in the future without any warnings. Because of that, the inline functions should be used instead.

[requireEclmap=17]
### The table
The following table contains all known transformations, although some of them are still WIP and need checking facts. As of now, take everything written here with a grain of salt. **VERY IMPORTANT, READ THIS**: Every transform has (at least) 2 different inline functions, 1 for [ins=609,13] and 1 for [ins=611,13]. All functions follow the same naming convention, so for example `etExSpeedUp` is for [ins=611,13] and `etExSpeedUpSet` is for [ins=609,13].

| ID        | Inline function                                                          | Description                                                |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | [code]etExSpeedUp(int et, int isAsync)[/code] [br] [code]etExSpeedUpSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync)[/code]| Make the bullet move really fast for a short amount of time. More precisely, it adds `5.0f` speed to the bullet and decelerates back to the original speed in `16` frames. |
| 2         | [code]etExAnim(int et, int isAsync, int anim)[/code] [br] [code]etExAnimSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int anim)[/code] | Calls ANM interrupt (`anim + 7`) on the bullet's ANM script, displaces the bullet's position by `(velocity.x, velocity.y) * -4.0`, disables the bullet's hitbox, and the bullet moves at half speed while the transform is active. The next transformation in the list is executed when the ANM script's `I0` variable is non-zero. This is meant to be used for spawn animations, of which there are three by default: `0`, `1`, and `2`, each of them being bigger and longer in duration than the previous. |
| 4         | [code]etExAccel(int et, int isAsync, int time, float spd, float ang)[/code] [br] [code]etExAccelSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, float spd, float ang)[/code] | Make the bullet accelerate by `spd` per frame in direction `ang` for `time` frames. `ang` can be `NEGF` to use bullet's current movement angle. |
| 8         | [code]etExAngleAccel(int et, int isAsync, int time, float spd, float angVel)[/code] [br] [code]etExAngleAccelSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, float spd, float angVel)[/code] | For `time` frames, bullet acceleration is set to `spd` (acceleration angle is the same as bullet's current movement angle) and angular velocity is set to `angVel`. |
| 8         | [code]etExAngleAccelLaser(int et, int isAsync, int a, int b, float r, float s)[/code] [br] [code]etExAngleAccelLaserSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, int b, float r, float s)[/code] | Same as above, but takes 1 additional parameter that's supposedly used by lasers, needs investigation. |
| 16        | [code]etExStep(int et, int isAsync, int time, int cnt, int type, float r, float s)[/code] [br] [code]etExStepSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, int cnt, int type, float r, float s)[/code] | In `time` frames, the bullet will slow down to `0` speed and get angle/speed modification based on `type`, `r` and `s`. This is repeated `cnt` times. For a more in-depth description, check the `etExStep` table below. |
| 32        | - | Unknown... |
| 64        | [code]etExBounce(int et, int isAsync, int cnt, int walls, float newSpd)[/code] [br] [code]etExBounceSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int cnt, int walls, float newSpd)[/code] | Allow the bullet to bounce off the edges of the screen `cnt` times. The edges it's allowed to bounce off are specified by the `walls` parameter (refer to constants [here](#s=MERLIN/doc/globals/etama-etc)). The speed after the bounce will be set to `newSpd`, or kept as-is if `newSpd` is `NEGF`. The transformations after this one won't be executed until the bullet bounces the given amount of times. Therefore, this can be used to detect when the bullet reaches the edge of the screen. |
| 64        | [code]etExBounceCustom(int et, int isAsync, int cnt, int walls, float newSpd, float x, float y)[/code] [br] [code]etExBounceCustomSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int cnt, int walls, float newSpd, float x, float y)[/code] | Same as above, but the point at which the bullets bounce can be modified with the `x` and `y` parameters - `x` specifies the distance from left/right edge of the screen where the bullets will bounce, and `y` specifies the distance from top/bottom edge of the screen. |
| 128        | [code]etExInvuln(int et, int isAsync, int time)[/code] [br] [code]etExInvulnSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time)[/code] | Makes the bullet invulnerable to bombs for `time` frames. Does NOT stop the next transformation from executing for the duration of invulnerability. |
| 256        | [code]etExOffscreen(int et, int isAsync, int time, int b)[/code] [br] [code]etExOffscreenSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, int b)[/code] | Makes the bullet not delete when offscreen for `time` frames. Effect of `b` is unknown, although there is a pretty large amount of code at `th17.exe+1961b` that does... something if it's nonzero. It seems to be related to some ANM stuff. If anyone figures it out, let me know. Also, this transform does NOT stop the next transformation from executing for the duration of the effect.|
| 512        | [code]etExSprite(int et, int isAsync, int type, int color)[/code] [br] [code]etExSpriteSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int a, int b)[/code] | Change the bullet sprite (and use the corresponding hitbox). `type` and `color` are the same as in [ins=602,17]. When the color argument `b` is OR-ed with `32768`, the sprite is immediately set without replaying the spawn animation. |
| 1024       | [code]etExDelete(int et, int isAsync, int eff)[/code] [br] [code]etExDeleteSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int eff)[/code] | Deletes the bullet. There are 2 different delete animations that can be used, use the `eff` parameter to choose which (either `0` or `1`). |
| 2048       | [code]etExSound(int et, int isAsync, int id)[/code] [br] [code]etExSoundSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int a)[/code] | Play the given sound, IDs are the same as for [ins=516,17]. Refer to the [sound effect table](#s=MERLIN/doc/globals/sfx). |
| 4096       | [code]etExWrap(int et, int isAsync, int cnt, int walls, float newSpd)[/code] [br] [code]etExWrapSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int a, int b, float r)[/code] | Same as `etExBounce`, but instead of bouncing the bullet will wrap to the other side of the screen. |
| 8192       | [code]etExShootPrep(int et, int isAsync, int aim, int transformIndex, int cnt1, int cnt2, float ang1, float ang2, float spd1, float spd2)[/code] [br] [code]etExShootPrepSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int aim, int transformIndex, int cnt1, int cnt2, float ang1, float ang2, float spd1, float spd2)[/code] | 1st part of the bullet spawning transformation. Sets the bullet manager properties that will be used to shoot bullets. `ang1` can be set to `NEGF` to use the angle of the bullet that runs the transformation as `ang1`. The spawned bullets will use the same `etEx` list as this one, except they'll start from index given by `transformIndex`. This transform requires using `etExShoot` right after it to actually shoot the bullets. |
| 16384      | [code]etExShoot(int et, int isAsync, int type, int color, int delete, int eff)[/code] [br] [code]etExShootSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int type, int color, int delete, int eff)[/code] | 2nd part of the bullet spawning transformation. Sets the sprite type/color (same as [ins=602,17]) of the spawned bullets. If `delete` is nonzero, the bullet that runs this transformation will be deleted, and an animation based on `eff` will play (same as in `etExDelete`). This transform requires using `etExShootPrep` right before it to define the rest of properties. |
| 134217728  | [code]etExShootLaserPrep(int et, int isAsync, int a, int b, int c, int d, float r, float s, float m, float n)[/code] [br] [code]etExShootLaserSetPrep(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int a, int b, int c, int d, float r, float s, float m, float n)[/code] | Similar to `etExShootPrep` but for lasers. Sets the laser type (`0` = line laser, `1` = infinite laser), `b` is the sprite, `c` is the color, `d` is whether to delete the original bullet, `r` is the angle (`-999999` to use the angle of the bullet), `s` is the speed, `m` is the initial laser length, `n` is the final laser length |
| 16384      | [code]etExShootLaser(int et, int isAsync, int a, int b, int c, int d, float r, float s, float m, float n)[/code] [br] [code]etExShootLaserSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int a, int b, int c, int d, float r, float s, float m, float n)[/code] | Version of `etExShoot` that takes more parameters, intended to be used to shoot lasers combined with `etExShootLaserPrep`. If the laser is a line laser (type 0): `a` is the shoot sfx, `b` is the transform sfx, `c` is the transform index to start from, `d` is unused. [br] If the laser is an infinite laser (type 1): `a` is the waiting time, `b` is the expand time, `c` is the laser duration, `d` is the shrink time. [br] In both cases, `r` is unknown, `s` is the laser width, `m` is the spawn distance (like in etDist), `n` is unknown. |
| 32768      | - | This sets a value used in some of the [ins=632,17] functions. The meaning of the value is entirely dependent on said function. |
| 65536      | [code]etExJump(int et, int isAsync, int index, int cnt)[/code] [br] [code]etExJumpSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int index, int cnt)[/code] | Jump to transformation at the given index, typically used for loops. `cnt` determines the maximum amount of times this transformation can execute. |
| 131072     | [code]etExMove(int et, int isAsync, int time, int mode, float x, float y)[/code] [br] [code]etExMoveSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, int mode, float x, float y)[/code] | In `time` frames using mode `mode`, move the bullet to absolute position `(x,y)`. For the duration of the movement, bullet's normal movement gets disabled. After the movement finishes, the original speed is restored, but the bullet keeps the angle it used when moving from its position before the transformation to the position `(x,y)`. I have no idea what kind of hilariously broken effects you may get when trying to use this with some other transform at once by using the `isAsync` flag. When the mode argument `b` is OR-ed with `256`, the position is relative to the bullet's current position instead. |
| 262144     | [code]etExVel(int et, int isAsync, float ang, float spd)[/code] [br] [code]etExVelSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, float ang, float spd)[/code] | Immediately change bullet angle to `ang` and bullet speed to `spd`. `ang` can be set to `NEGF` to keep current angle, and `spd` can be set to `NEGF` to set current speed. If both are set to `NEGF`, the transform won't do anything. Wowie! |
| 524288     | [code]etExVelAdd(int et, int isAsync, int a, float ang, float spd)[/code] [br] [code]etExVelAddSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int a, float ang, float spd)[/code] | Apply velocity in direction `ang` and speed `spd` to the bullet. The duration argument `a` is broken, and the transform always lasts infinitely long instead. Setting it to `0` is known to freeze the game.|
| 1048576    | [code]etExBright(int et, int isAsync, int type)[/code] [br] [code]etExBrightSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int type)[/code] | Set bullet brightness effect based on `type`. `0` is no effect, `1` is glowing and `2` is darkness. |
| 2097152    | [code]etExAccelWeird(int et, int isAsync, int time, float spd, float ang)[/code] [br] [code]etExAccelWeirdSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, float spd, float ang)[/code] | This is pretty much the same as transform 4, but the value of acceleration is `(spd - currBulletSpeed) / time`.
| 4194304    | [code]etExSize(int et, int isAsync, int time, int mode, float sizeFrom, float sizeTo)[/code] [br] [code]etExSizeSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time, int mode, float sizeFrom, float sizeTo)[/code] | In `time` frames using mode `mode`, change bullet size from `sizeFrom` to `sizeTo`. This changes both the sprite and the hitbox. |
| 8388608    | [code]etExSave(int et, int isAsync)[/code] [br] [code]etExSaveSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync)[/code] | Save current angle to player and current coordinates of the bullet. These stored values can be used with some functionalities of `etExStep`. |
| 16777216   | [code]etExEnmCreate(int et, int isAsync)[/code] [br] [code]etExEnmCreateSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync)[/code] | Spawn an enemy using the sub set by [ins=640,17]. The `a`,`b`,`c`,`d` and `r`,`s`,`m`,`n` arguments set the spawned enemy's `I0`,`I1`,`I2`,`I3` and `F0`,`F1`,`F2`,`F3` variables respectively. |
| 33554432   | [code]etExLayer(int et, int isAsync, int layer)[/code] [br] [code]etExLayerSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int layer)[/code] | Change bullet's layer based on `layer`. TODO: check if it increments current layer or sets it directly. |
| 67108864   | [code]etExDelay(int et, int isAsync, int time)[/code] [br] [code]etExDelaySet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time)[/code] | Hide the bullet for `time` frames. During this time, it will not move, will be invisible and won't have a hitbox. If used as a first transformation, can be used to delay when the bullet actually appears. |
| 536870912  | [code]etExHitbox(int et, int isAsync, float r)[/code] [br] [code]etExHitboxSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, float r)[/code] | Change the bullet hitbox to original hitbox multiplied by `r`. If `r` is `0.0f` the hitbox will be completely disabled, `-1.0f` restores original hitbox. Valid layers are 0-5, and each bullet type has a default layer. Layers can be found [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661703018580017153/985920637757423646/etlayers.png) made by Dai. |
| -2147483648| [code]etExWait(int et, int isAsync, int time)[/code] [br] [code]etExWaitSet(int et, int slot, int isAsync, int time)[/code] | Wait for `time` frames before moving to the next transformation. |


### etExStep and etExStepSet table
The following table contains all known modes for etExStep and etExStepSet:

| c-value |                                                             Description                                                       |
|:-------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c == 0: |                                    Adds `r` to the bullet's angle, and set the speed to `s`.                                  |
| c == 1: |                     Set the bullet's angle to the angle towards the player + `r`, and sets the speed to`s.`                   |
| c == 2: | Sets the bullet's angle to the angle towards the player from the position saved with etExSave + `r`, and sets the speed to`s.`|
| c == 3: |                    Sets the bullet's angle to the angle saved with etExSave + `r`, and sets the speed to`s.`                  |
| c == 4: |                                       Sets the bullet's angle to `r` and the speed to`s.`                                     |
| c == 5: |                     Adds a random value between (`-r`, `r`) to the bullet's angle, and sets the speed to`s.`                  |
| c == 6: |      Sets the bullet's angle to the angle towards the player + a random value between (`-r`, `r`), and sets the speed to s.   |
| c == 7: |                    Sets the bullet's speed to a random value between (`-s`, `s`). The angle remains the same.                 |
